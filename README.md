# AI Skill Predictor Tool

## Overview
The AI Skill Predictor Tool is a full-stack learning analytics application
that predicts a student's skill level based on test performance and behavior.

The system classifies students into Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
using a machine learning model trained on multiple performance factors.
